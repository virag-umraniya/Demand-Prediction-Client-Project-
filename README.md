# Demand-Prediction-Client-Project-
Here are a few options for a project description for your GitHub repo, all under 300 characters.  Option 1: Developed a predictive model to forecast future product demand, utilizing Python and the SARIMA model to analyze historical sales data. 

## Business Problem
- The case business case is on the inventory management. Keeping Inventory of spare in various service
centre to the market demand is always a challenge as most service centres spends significant amount in
spare parts inventory costs. In spite of this, availability of spare parts is been one of the problem areas.

- PROJECT GOAL: 1. Create Predictive model for inventory forecasting so that service centre achieve JIT
standards.

## Project Overview:

- Objective: To build a predictive tool that accurately forecasts product sales.

- Methodology: Utilized historical sales data and the SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model to capture seasonal patterns and trends.

- Technology Stack:

- Python

- Pandas & NumPy (for data manipulation)

- Scikit-learn (for model evaluation)

- Statsmodels (for the SARIMA model)
